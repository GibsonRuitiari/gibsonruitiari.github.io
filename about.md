## About Me

I'm a programmer and an android-developer with a background in law. By day I am a lawyer, by night, a programmer. 
I also have a newfound passion for tea. My journey has always been driven by curiosity and a desire to embrace new challenges. 
Currently, I'm immersing myself in embedded programming with C and exploring circuit design purely out of fascination.

For the past six years, I've dedicated myself to developing mobile applications in Kotlin, 
contributing to a variety of projects—from food delivery and ride-hailing platforms to laundry services and e-commerce apps. 
Alongside my development work, I've had the pleasure of helping other developers enhance their Android skills, 
notably through teaching Jetpack Compose at Droidcon Academy.

## **What This Space Is About**

If you've ever reached a point where android-app development starts to feel repetitive and you're yearning for a challenge 
that truly pushes your limits, then this might be the place for you. The Kotlin ecosystem often feels confined to Android, 
making it seem like we're continually building the same apps with different UI frameworks.

This series is about expanding those horizons. We aim to explore the full potential of Kotlin beyond the Android sphere.
Together, we'll tackle genuine programming challenges, apply universal coding principles, and develop practical solutions—not just revisit familiar tutorial.

In sum, this space is not focused on ‘how to do x and y in Kotlin’, rather it is about exploration with Kotlin, heavily 
focusing on understanding the inner workings of programming, as well as some pitfalls that the author has fallen into.

Therefore, a good chunk of the articles in this series will be advanced but I will try my best to explain things simply, 
while not compromising the rigor of the subject.

## Frequency of the Posts

Since I have a day job (Yes, I need to provide legal solutions to people’s problems) things might be hectic so I might not write as frequently as possible.
You can, however, expect new posts every 3–4 weeks. And when a post goes live, you can trust that it's been crafted with care and is worth your time.
