Hi, I'm Gibson. A lawyer, a programmer (and/or an android developer) + tea-enthusiast

I spend lots of hours programming, reading books and papers about algorithms, circuit design, embedded programming, databases and language development,
so you don’t have to (but you still should).

Like most curious minds, I often found myself searching for well-curated, in-depth information on these topics, only to be met with scattered, incomplete, or overly simplified explanations. This blog is my small contribution to improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the vast sea of technical content. My goal is to discuss obscure, forgotten algorithms and implementations and rarely discussed topics like databases, programming languages, and break down complex ideas into digestible insights, and explore the lesser-known yet fascinating aspects of computing.

If you're someone who enjoys diving deep into the mechanics of algorithms, system design, and unconventional tech, I hope this space becomes a valuable resource for you.
